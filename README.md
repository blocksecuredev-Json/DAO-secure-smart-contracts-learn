This repository contains a basic related real life DAO voting smart contract written in Solidity.

Current Features:

- Cancel Proposal function

Iâ€™m currently learning the DAO system, it's flaws and security measures, smart contracts development and will continue improving this project as I gain more knowledge and skills.
